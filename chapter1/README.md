# Chapter 1 
The following told us about the core of programming language:
> Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:
>   - primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,
>   - means of combination, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
>   - means of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units. 

## Functions and their process

recursive process: a chain of deferred operations
iterative process: state can be summarized by a fixed number of state variables
